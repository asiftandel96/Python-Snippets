    "# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING WITH PYTHON PROGRAMMING\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects. In this tutorial, you’ll learn the basics of object-oriented programming in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, objects are like the components of a system. Think of a program as a factory assembly line of sorts. At each step of the assembly line a system component processes some material, ultimately transforming raw material into a finished product.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object contains data, like the raw or preprocessed materials at each step on an assembly line, and behavior, like the action each assembly line component performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class, which is like a blueprint for creating an object\n",
    "\n",
    "Use classes to create new objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Model systems with class inheritance\n",

    "What Is Object-Oriented Programming in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, an object could represent a person with properties like a name, age, and address and behaviors such as walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or it could represent an email with properties like a recipient list, subject, and body and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things, like cars, as well as relations between things, like companies and employees, students and teachers, and so on. OOP models real-world entities as software objects that have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common programming paradigm is procedural programming, which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, that flow sequentially in order to complete a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway is that objects are at the center of object-oriented programming in Python, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a Class in Python:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive data structures—like numbers, strings, and lists—are designed to represent simple pieces of information, such as the cost of an apple, the name of a poem, or your favorite colors, respectively. What if you want to represent something more complex?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s say you want to track employees in an organization. You need to store some basic information about each employee, such as their name, age, position, and the year they started working."

    "There are a number of issues with this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it can make larger code files more difficult to manage. If you reference kirk[0] several lines away from where the kirk\n",
    "\n",
    "list is declared, will you remember that the element with index 0 is the employee’s name?\n",

    "A great way to make this type of code more manageable and more maintainable is to use classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes vs Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are used to create user-defined data structures. Classes define functions called methods, which identify the behaviors and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you’ll create a Dog class that stores some information about the characteristics and behaviors that an individual dog can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for how something should be defined. It doesn’t actually contain any data. The Dog class specifies that a name and an age are necessary for defining a dog, but it doesn’t contain the name or age of any specific dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the class is the blueprint, an instance is an object that is built from a class and contains real data. An instance of the Dog class is not a blueprint anymore. It’s an actual dog with a name, like Miles, who’s four years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, a class is like a form or questionnaire. An instance is like a form that has been filled out with information. Just like many people can fill out the same form with their own unique information, many instances can be created from a single class."

There are a number of properties that we can choose from, including name, age, coat color, and breed. To keep things simple, we’ll just use name and age.\n",
    "\n",

Every time a new Dog object is created, .__init__() sets the initial state of the object by assigning the values of the object’s properties. That is, .__init__() initializes each new instance of the class.\n",
