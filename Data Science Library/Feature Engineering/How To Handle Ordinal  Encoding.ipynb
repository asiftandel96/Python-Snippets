    "Ordinal Measurement Advantages\n",
    "Ordinal measurement is normally used for surveys and questionnaires. Statistical analysis is applied to the responses once they are collected to place the people who took the survey into the various categories. The data is then compared to draw inferences and conclusions about the whole surveyed population with regard to the specific variables. The advantage of using ordinal measurement is ease of collation and categorization. If you ask a survey question without providing the variables, the answers are likely to be so diverse they cannot be converted to statistics.\n",

    "Ordinal Measurement Disadvantages\n",
    "The same characteristics of ordinal measurement that create its advantages also create certain disadvantages. The responses are often so narrow in relation to the question that they create or magnify bias that is not factored into the survey. For example, on the question about satisfaction with the governor, people might be satisfied with his job performance but upset about a recent sex scandal. The survey question might lead respondents to state their dissatisfaction about the scandal, in spite of satisfaction with his job performance -- but the statistical conclusion will not differentiate.\n",
